About this blog.

<!--more-->

This website is designed to showcase some of my favourite pieces of work as a data scientist. It will include well-documented tutorials, less well-documented workflows, and `README`s from my released packages. I hope you find it an enjoyable read ðŸ“”.

If you come across any errors or have trouble understanding the code/packages, I would be very happy for you to email me at <andrew@andrew-little.com>.
