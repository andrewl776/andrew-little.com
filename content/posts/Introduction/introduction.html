<p>This website is designed to showcase some of my favourite pieces of work as a data scientist. It will include well-documented tutorials, less well-documented workflows, and <code>README</code>s from my released packages. I hope you find it an enjoyable read ðŸ“”.</p>
<p>If you come across any errors or have trouble understanding the code/packages, I would be very happy for you to email me at <a href="mailto:andrew@andrew-little.com" class="email">andrew@andrew-little.com</a>.</p>
